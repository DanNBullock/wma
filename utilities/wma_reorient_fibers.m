%
% When computing Tract Profiles it is important that each subject's fiber
% group has the same start and end points. This function will make sure
% this is true by flipping the start and endpoints of any fiber that passes
% through roi2 before roi1. roi1 and roi2 can either be at the endpoints of
% the fiber group or can be waypoint rois along the trajectory of the fiber
% group.
%
% Input:
%
% fg            - Fiber group
% roi1          - The first roi that the fibers should pass through
% roi2          - The second roi that the fibers should pass through
%
% Output:
% fg            - Fiber group with the fibers reoriented appropriately
% flippedfibers - A logical denoting which fibers were flipped
